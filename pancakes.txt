Ingredients:
1 cup plain flour
1 cup milk
1 egg
pinch of salt
Vegetable oil

1. Whisk the egg, flour milk and a pinch of salt together.  Let stand for 1 minute

2. Heat a frying pan on medium-high heat.  Drizzle a small quantity of oil over the pan

3. Pour in enough mixture to cover the middle of the pan (about half the way out from the middle)

4. Tilt the pan round to make the mixture cover the whole pan

5. Put the pan back on the heat and wait until the surface of the mixture changes colour.

6. Place a spatula gently under the edge to unstick the pancake so you can flip it

7. Flip it over and cook the other side for about the same time


Voila! You have a delicious pancake.

Makes about 4 or 5 pancakes.
